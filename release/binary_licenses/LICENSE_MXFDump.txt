intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a worldwide, 
compensation-free, nonexclusive license, subject to compliance with the Distribution and 
Production Use Requirements of Section 3 below:

2.1.1. under copyrights, to download, store, reproduce and display the AAF SDK, 
without alteration, solely for the purpose of Your internal review and evaluation of the 
AAF SDK, and for no commercial use whatsoever;

2.1.2. under copyrights, to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, prepare derivative 
works of the AAF SDK (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and to 
combine the AAF SDK (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications with other 
computer program code not governed by the terms of this Agreement to create a Larger 
Work;

2.1.3. under copyrights to redistribute the AAF SDK (or portions thereof) in Source Code 
and Executable form with or without Modifications or as part of a Larger Work under the 
terms and conditions of this Agreement; and

2.1.4. under a claim of any patent or patent application licensable by the Contributor and 
necessarily infringed by the making, practicing, using, selling, offering for sale, or 
importing of its Contributor Version, to make, practice, use, sell, offer for sale, and 
import, and/or otherwise dispose of, the Contributor Version of such Contributor.  This 
patent license shall apply to a claim of a patent licensable by a Contributor only if, at the 
time the Contributor should have delivered under Section 3.1 to the Standards Body its 
Contributor Version, the Contributor Version necessarily infringes the claim.  No license 
under any claim of any patent or patent application is granted to You: a) for code that 
You delete from the AAF SDK; b) separate from the AAF SDK; or c) for infringements 
caused by: i) Your Modifications of the AAF SDK or ii) the combination of the AAF 
SDK with other software or devices, including but not limited to Your Modifications or 
any Larger Work.

2.1.5. No other rights.  You neither grant nor receive any license or right to use any 
trademark, trade name, or maskwork hereunder. Without limitation of the foregoing, You 
will use the terms "Advanced Authoring Format" or "AAF" in Your Contributor Version 
and/or Your Modifications only if Your Contributor Version and/or Modifications are 
designated as a Standard Version of the AAF SDK. Except for the rights expressly 
provided by this Agreement, a) You shall not have any other rights in the AAF SDK, and 
b) You neither grant nor receive, by implication, estoppel, or otherwise, any rights to any 
patents, copyrights, or other intellectual property rights.

2.2.  Reciprocal Patent License.  As an express condition to the license grant in Section 
2.1.4, and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to third party 
intellectual property claims, You agree to grant all Contributors and other licensees of 
this AAF SDK a worldwide, compensation-free, and otherwise reasonable and 
nondiscriminatory nonexclusive license under a claim of any patent or patent application 
licensable by You and necessarily infringed by the making, practicing, using, selling, 
offering for sale or importing of this AAF SDK, to make, practice, use, sell, offer for sale, 
and import, and/or otherwise dispose of, this AAF SDK.  This patent license shall apply 
to a claim of a patent licensable by You only if the AAF SDK You have been licensed 
(i.e., “this AAF SDK”) necessarily infringes the claim.  No license under any claim of 
any patent or patent application is granted by You: a) for code that is deleted by another 
from this AAF SDK; b) separate from this AAF SDK; or c) for infringements caused by: 
i) Modifications by another to this AAF SDK or ii) the combination by another of this 
AAF SDK with other software or devices, including but not limited to Modifications or 
any Larger Work.
2.3.  Defensive Suspension.  If any Contributor, any licensee of the AAF SDK, or any of 
its Affiliates (“the sued party”) is first sued for patent infringement by You or any of 
Your Affiliates, on account of the sued party’s making, practicing, using, selling, offering 
for sale, or importing of the AAF SDK, then the sued party may terminate all license 
grants and any other rights provided under this Agreement to You.  The foregoing shall 
not apply if the patent infringement suit that would otherwise trigger this clause is solely 
based on a failure to comply with the scope of the license grants set forth in this 
Agreement.
3. Distribution and Production Use Requirements.

3.1. Delivery of Source Code to Standards Body.  You agree to deliver to the Standards 
Body Your Modifications and/or Your Contributor Version in Source Code form within 
sixty (60) days after You first distribute or use in production any AAF SDK (or portion 
thereof) with Your Modifications.  If Your Modifications and/or Your Contributor 
Version do not comply with all requirements of the Standard and all other requirements 
set out by the Standards Body, You must also deliver to the Standards Body a description 
of any deviation from the Standard resulting from Your Modifications.

3.2. Grant Back of Your Modifications to the Standards Body.  Subject to the terms and 
conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Standards Body a worldwide, 
nonexclusive, compensation-free license to Your Contributor Version and Modifications, 
in whole and in part, and with and without additional Modifications, in the same scope 
and for the same purposes as the licenses granted to You in Section 2.1 above. Without 
limiting Your right to reproduce, use, and distribute Your Contributor Version, the 
Standards Body may choose in its sole discretion to designate Your Contributor Version 
a Standard Version of the AAF SDK, and/or may use any part of Your Contributor 
Version, with or without other Modifications, to create and designate a Standard Version 
of the AAF SDK.  The Standards Body may redistribute a Standard Version of the AAF 
SDK under the terms of this Agreement.

3.3.  Required Notice in Source Code.  The Source Code for the AAF SDK (or portion 
thereof), with or without Modifications, may only be distributed under the terms of this 
Agreement, and, at a minimum, within every copy of the AAF SDK (or portion thereof) 
that You distribute, You must include a copy of this Agreement within a file called 
“AAFSDKPSL.TXT” in a sub-directory named “LEGAL” along with the AAF SDK 
Source Code. You may not offer or impose any terms on any version of the AAF SDK 
(or portion thereof) that alters or restricts this Agreement, or the recipients' rights 
hereunder. Your license for shipment of the AAF SDK (or portion thereof) with or 
without Modifications is conditioned upon Your full compliance with this Section 3.  
You must duplicate or retain the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code for 
the AAF SDK.  If You create Original Code to be distributed under this Agreement, You 
must insert the notice in Exhibit A into the Source Code file for that Original Code, and 
you may insert Your name as the Initial Developer.  If You created one or more 
Modification(s), You may add Your name as a Contributor to such a notice in any file 
containing such Modification(s).  If Your Contributor Version and/or Your Modifications 
do not comply with all requirements of the Standard and all other requirements set out by 
the Standards Body that are in effect sixty (60) days before distribution or production, 
You must provide a description with Your Contributor Version and/or Your 
Modifications of any deviation from the Standard resulting from Your Modifications; 
and, unless Your Contributor Version has been designated a Standard Version of the 
AAF SDK, You must prominently state that it is not a Standard Version. All Standard 
Versions of the AAF SDK must be so labeled.

3.4.  Required Notice for Larger Works.  In any documentation for a Larger Work, you 
must include the following notice:

“The Source Code version of the AAF SDK used herein is available from [INSERT 
YOUR NAME HERE] and/or the Advanced Media Wokflow Association, Inc., under the 
terms of the AAF SDK Public Source License Version 2.0.  A copy of this license is 
available at www.amwa.tv/licenses.”
The notice must be conspicuously included in the Larger Work, related documentation, or 
collateral in which You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to the AAF 
SDK.

3.5.  Licenses Granted by You for Larger Works.  You may distribute a Larger Work 
under Section 2.1 under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from 
this Agreement, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this Agreement. If 
You distribute the Larger Work under a different license, then You must make it 
absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this Agreement are offered by You 
alone, not by any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify each Contributor for any 
liability incurred by the Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.  You may 
choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity, or liability 
obligations to one or more recipients of a Larger Work. However, You may do so only on 
Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely 
clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You 
alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify other Contributors for any liability incurred by 
them as a result of warranty, support, indemnity, or liability terms You offer.

4. Application of this Agreement.  This Agreement applies to code to which a Contributor 
has attached the notice in Exhibit A.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY 
APPLICABLE LAW, THE AAF SDK (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION EACH 
STANDARD VERSION OF THE AAF SDK) IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITH ALL 
FAULTS, AND EACH CONTRIBUTOR AND THE STANDARDS BODY HEREBY 
DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, 
OR STATUTORY, WITH RESPECT TO THE AAF SDK (OR ANY ELEMENT 
THEREOF), INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY (IF ANY) IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY'S RIGHTS, 
TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, QUIET POSSESSION, QUALITY, LACK OF 
NEGLIGENCE, LACK OF WORKMANLIKE PERFORMANCE, LACK OF 
VIRUSES, ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OR RESPONSES, RESULTS, OR 
PERFORMANCE.  WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, EACH 
CONTRIBUTOR AND THE STANDARDS BODY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY (IF 
ANY) WARRANTY (A) REGARDING THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF 
THE AAF SDK, AND (B) THAT THE AAF SDK IS APPROPRIATE FOR ANY 
PARTICULAR USE OR THAT USE OF THE AAF SDK WILL BE 
UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE USE, 
QUALITY, AND PERFORMANCE OF THE AAF SDK IS WITH YOU.  THIS 
DISCLAIMER IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS AGREEMENT.  NO 
DISTRIBUTION OF THE AAF SDK, SPECIFICALLY INCLUDING ANY 
STANDARD VERSIONS OF THE AAF SDK, IS AUTHORIZED EXCEPT UNDER 
THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. Termination.  This Agreement and the rights granted hereunder will terminate 
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 
30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain 
in effect beyond the termination of this Agreement under this Section 6 shall survive.  
Any license granted by You to any Contributor, any licensee of the AAF SDK, or the 
Standards Body, and any end user license agreement for Larger Works containing or 
linking to the AAF SDK in Executable form that have been validly granted by You 
hereunder prior to termination shall continue in full force even after such termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY CONTRIBUTOR 
AND/OR THE STANDARDS BODY BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY 
DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, GENERAL, ECONOMIC, INCIDENTAL, 
PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED 
TO DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR BUSINESS 
INTERRUPTION), OR FOR ANY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM LOSS OF USE, 
LOSS OF DATA, OR LOSS OF ANTICIPATED PROFITS, IN ANY WAY RELATED 
TO USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE AAF SDK, OR OTHERWISE IN 
CONNECTION WITH ANY PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF THE 
CONTRIBUTOR AND/OR THE STANDARDS BODY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF 
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY 
FOR LACK OF SATISFACTION WITH THE AAF SDK IS TO DISCONTINUE 
USING THE AAF SDK. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY 
TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH 
PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH 
LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR 
LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS 
EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. Government End Users.  U.S. Government: If the AAF SDK is being acquired by 
or on behalf of the U.S. Government or by a U.S. Government prime contractor or 
subcontractor (at any tier), then the Government's rights in the AAF SDK and 
accompanying documentation shall be only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in 
accordance with 48 C.F.R. 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense 
(DoD) acquisitions) and with 48 C.F.R. 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DoD acquisitions).

9. Miscellaneous. This Agreement shall constitute the complete and exclusive agreement 
concerning the subject matter hereof. The Exhibit identified in this Agreement is 
incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof.  If any provision of this 
Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason in a jurisdiction, such provision 
shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable, and such holding 
shall not affect the enforceability of such provision under other circumstances or in other 
jurisdictions, or of the remaining provisions hereof under all circumstances. None of the 
provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been waived by any act or 
acquiescence on the part of any Contributor and/or the Standards Body, their agents or 
employees, but only by an instrument in writing signed by them. With respect to disputes 
in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do 
business in the United States of America, any litigation relating to this Agreement shall 
be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Commonwealth of 
Massachusetts, with the losing party responsible for costs, including without limitation, 
court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.  The application of the United 
Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly 
excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be 
construed against the drafter shall not apply to this Agreement.

10. Effective Date.  The terms and conditions of this Agreement will become effective 
upon Your first use, installation, or copying of the AAF SDK.  You hereby represent and 
warrant that You have full authority to enter into this Agreement and grant the licenses
