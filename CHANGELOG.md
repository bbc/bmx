## Snapshot 2016-03-30

### Features

* preliminary support for AMWA AS-11 X1 to X4. The variants that don't use
  RP 2057 AVC-Intra, e.g. Long GOP, require the 'avc' branch.
* support for AMWA AS-10
* support for embedding XML / text objects (SMPTE RP 2057)
* support for multi-channel audio tracks and labels (SMPTE ST 377-4)
* support for reading non-seekable MXF streams containing AVC-Intra or D-10
* support for memory-mapped MXF file access in Visual C++ builds only
* bmxparse application showing raw essence properties extracted by the essence
  parser classes
* default Material Package Track Number is now 0. The AMWA AS-02 and AS-11 UK
  DPP flavours set it to a non-zero value
* removed frame rate restrictions from VC-3 (Avid DNxHD)
* apps: add options to disable tracks by type
* avid: always output display and sampled x/y offset properties
* mxf2raw: show display x/y offset if present in file

### Bug fixes

* mxf2raw: fix UL/UUID detection for the URN text representation
* h264dump: fix buffering period SEI parsing
* avid: include pre-charge in physical source package timecode calculation

### Notes

* raw2bmx is currently missing some of the AS-11 X1 to X4 functionality,
  including MCA labelling. The workaround it to wrap the raw essence first using
  raw2bmx and then re-wrap using bmxtranswrap.
